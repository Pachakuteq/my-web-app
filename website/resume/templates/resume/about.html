        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Jose David, an IT Support Specialist and aspiring Backend Developer with over 3 years of experience troubleshooting systems, improving reliability, and optimizing IT operations. My journey in IT has given me a strong understanding of how technology connects infrastructure, users, and processes — a perspective I now bring into backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
           I have a solid foundation in programming and scripting, which allows me to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and create integrations that make systems more efficient. I’m particularly interested in backend technologies that focus on performance, scalability, and security, and I enjoy solving technical challenges that push me to think logically and creatively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working across different platforms and environments has taught me adaptability and problem-solving under pressure. I’m always exploring new frameworks, tools, and concepts in server management, networks, and cybersecurity, continuously improving my skills to build reliable, well-structured backend solutions.

        <h1>FROM BROKEN MACHINE TO LINE OF CODE</h1>
        <p>
            Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been captivated by how things work. I would spend hours taking apart gadgets, repairing mechanical devices, and even building small contraptions just to see them function. My fascination started with physics and science, but it soon extended to computers, where I discovered how software could breathe life into technology and create entirely new possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I grew, I found myself setting up and fixing computers for family and friends. These experiences taught me not just the mechanics of devices, but also the patience and problem-solving skills needed to troubleshoot and improve systems. Over time, my curiosity naturally led me toward software development and cybersecurity, areas where logic, creativity, and strategy intersect to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            What excites me most is the intersection of hardware and software — understanding how things work from the inside out, and using that knowledge to build smarter, more reliable solutions. Even as I dive deeper into backend development, I still carry my love for mechanical systems, dreaming of one day blending both worlds into projects that are practical, innovative, and well-engineered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Driven by curiosity and a love of learning, I continue to explore, experiment, and challenge myself — always seeking ways to turn ideas into tangible, intelligent systems that make a difference.
